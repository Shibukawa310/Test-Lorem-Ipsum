## FOREWORD
>This section is non-normative

ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization. 

The procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further maintenance are described in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1. In particular, the different approval criteria needed for the different types of ISO documents should be noted. This document was drafted in accordance with the editorial rules of the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2 (see [www.iso.org/directives](https://www.iso.org/directives)). 

ISO draws attention to the possibility that the implementation of this document may involve the use of (a) patent(s). ISO takes no position concerning the evidence, validity or applicability of any claimed patent rights in respect thereof. As of the date of publication of this document, ISO had not received notice of (a) patent(s) which may be required to implement this document. However, implementers are cautioned that this may not represent the latest information, which may be obtained from the patent database available at www.iso.org/patents. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.

This document was prepared by Technical Committee ISO/TC 34, Food products, Subcommittee SC 4, Cereals and pulses. 

This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition (ISO 17301-1:2016), which has been technically revised. 

The main changes are as follows:   
— updating of normative references;   
— revision of Clause 9.

## INTRODUCTION
>This section is non normative

This document was developed in response to worldwide demand for minimum specifications for rice traded internationally, since most commercial bulks of grain, which have not been screened or aspirated, contain a proportion of other grains, weed seeds, chaff, straw, stones, sand, etc. The vegetable materials can have physical and biological properties which differ from those of the main constituent and can therefore affect the storage behaviour.

Rice is a permanent host to a considerable microflora; most of these microorganisms are cosmopolitan, the majority are innocuous, but some produce harmful by-products. Microflora communities present on freshly harvested rice include many types of bacteria, moulds and yeasts. While the rice is ripening and its moisture content is falling, the number of field microorganisms, mainly bacteria, diminishes. When the rice is harvested, it is invaded by storage microorganisms and the field microflora gradually die out. If the mass fraction of moisture (formerly expressed as moisture content) is less than 18 %, the microflora does not multiply, whereas above 18 % it does so rapidly. Thus, at harvest, the qualitative and the quantitative composition of the microflora depends more upon ecological factors than upon the variety of the rice. During transport and storage, additions to the microfloral population occur. Microorganisms on the rice at harvest tend to die out during storage and are replaced by microorganisms adapted to storage conditions.

Storage losses have been estimated as being an average of 5 %, and as much as 30 %, especially in regions with climates favourable to the rapid development of agents of deterioration, such as tropical climates. The magnitude of these figures highlights the need to promote a rapid improvement in techniques of conservation worldwide.


## SCOPE
### General Scope
>This section is normative

This document specifies minimum requirements and test methods for rice (Oryza sativa L.). It is applicable to husked rice, husked parboiled rice, milled rice and milled parboiled rice, suitable for human consumption, directly or after reconditioning. It is not applicable to cooked rice product.

### Conformance and Notations
>This section is normative

If sections are marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in these sections are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.

The key words MAY, MUST, MUST NOT, OPTIONAL, RECOMMENDED, REQUIRED, SHOULD and SHOULD NOT in this document are to be interpreted as described in \[[__BCP 14__](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp14)\],  \[[__RFC2119__](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.0/#bib-rfc2119)\], \[[__RFC8174__](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.0/#bib-rfc8174)\] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## MAIN CONTENT
### General, organoleptic and health characteristics

Kernels of rice, whether parboiled, husked or milled, and whether whole or broken, SHALL be sound, clean and free from foreign odours which indicate deterioration.

NOTE National regulations can apply to maximum limits of levels of additives and pesticide residues and other contaminants.

The presence of living insects which are visible to the naked eye is not permitted. This should be determined before separating the bulk sample into test samples.

###   Physical and chemical characteristics
#### The mass fraction of moisture

The mass fraction of extraneous matter and defective kernels in husked and milled rice, whether or not parboiled, determined in accordance with Annex A, shall not be greater than the values specified in Table 1.

[Table 1: Maximum permissible mass fraction of defects]
