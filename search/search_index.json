Microflora communities present on freshly harvested rice include many types of bacteria, moulds and yeasts. While the rice is ripening and its moisture content is falling, the number of field microorganisms, mainly bacteria, diminishes. When the rice is harvested, it is invaded by storage microorganisms and the field microflora gradually die out. If the mass fraction of moisture (formerly expressed as moisture content) is less than 18 %, the microflora does not multiply, whereas above 18 % it does so rapidly. Thus, at harvest, the qualitative and the quantitative composition of the microflora depends more upon ecological factors than upon the variety of the rice. During transport and storage, additions to the microfloral population occur. Microorganisms on the rice at harvest tend to die out during storage and are replaced by microorganisms adapted to storage conditions.</p> <p>Storage losses have been estimated as being an average of 5 %, and as much as 30 %, especially in regions with climates favourable to the rapid development of agents of deterioration, such as tropical climates. The magnitude of these figures highlights the need to promote a rapid improvement in techniques of conservation worldwide.</p>"},{"location":"AX-001/#1-scope","title":"1.
